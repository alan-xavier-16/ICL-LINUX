The original material has more detail.\n",

    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How can I move around on my computer?\n",
    "- How can I see what files and directories I have?\n",
    "- How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?\n",
    "\n",

    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.\n",
    "- Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.\n",
    "- Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command\n",
